Comparative Analysis of Convolutional Neural Networks in Regards to Deepfake Detection
Fall 2024

Deepfake technologies pose a significant threat in the field of cybersecurity, requiring advanced deepfake detection methods to mitigate potentially malicious risks. This thesis conducts a comparative analysis of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for deepfake detection, focusing on the performance of the EfficientNetV2B0 and ResNet50 models. Using the FaceForensics++ dataset as input, this research will examine several key evaluation metrics including training and validation accuracy, training and validation loss, and training time per epoch, to assess each modelâ€™s efficacy and effectiveness. ResNet50 achieved a higher final validation accuracy of 88.41%, demonstrating a superior performance in identifying manipulated content, at the cost of longer training times per epoch. Alternatively, EfficientNetV2B0 reached a lower final validation accuracy of 79.88%, while exhibiting faster learning times and a reduction in demand for computational resources. This study stresses the trade-offs between achieving a higher detection accuracy and the optimization of computational efficiency. Furthermore, this will provide a broader comprehension into the practical considerations for the production and deployment of deepfake detection models for realistic environments. With the contribution of these findings, a broader understanding of CNN-based deepfake detection can be put to use and establish a foundation for future research and development that can focus on refining model scalability, improving evaluation metrics and augmenting learning patterns to overcome evolving deepfake techniques.
